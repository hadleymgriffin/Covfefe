Info
----
This application allows the user to enter the desired city and find coffee shops in that city (using MapKit).
All shops are displayed in a table view and with corresponding annotations on a map view. The user can select a shop
and it will take them to a detail view with the shops phone number, website (if available), and the weather at that
shop's location. The user can click on the website button to deploy the WebView (WKWebView) of the shop's site within 
the app. From the detail view, the user can also add that shop to their favorite shops list. From the home page, the 
user can access their favorite shops list. When the user clicks on a shop from this list, it takes them to a detail 
view with the shop information (phone and webview). From this page the user can access the favorite drinks list.
The user can view their favorite drinks, add drinks (with name, price, and calories), and delete drinks from this view.
